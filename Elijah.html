    <h2>Who is Elijah?</h2>
    <p>After a series of seriously serious rapid response questions, I have peered into the life of Elijah, and learned
        some of the comings and goings of this man of mystery. From his hobbies to his favorite foods and somewhere in
        between, this is the webpage about who Elijah Torres, if that is his real name, really is. </p>
    <h3><strong>Elijah's Dos and Don'ts.</strong> </h3>

    <h3> <strong>His Favorite Link of the Future.</strong> </h3>
    <a href="www.corgiorgy.com">The greatest thing you will see today.</a>
    <h3>Video Games.</h3>
    <p>His go to games are simple, sweet, and easy. His favorite at the moment is the revolutionary "Beat Saber", but the
        one that seems to always have a hold on him to the point he finds himself crawling back is Minecraft. </p>
